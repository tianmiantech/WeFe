## Note

This folder implement detection algorithms based on [PaddleDetection project](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection).

The original detection programs are compiled into single server program and multiple trainer program by paddle_fl. 
Thus, all algorithms supported by [PaddleDetection project](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleDetection) has their `federated counterpart`.

While, there are plenty test should be task before we could claim it. 

## How to use

See [example](../../../../examples/paddle_detection)
